## Introduction (and a note)

RimuEirnarn/ArchaentNakasaki is a young person that learns to code and writing. They like games and certain animes.

As they're wandering outside, they shall back with bliss.

**Note**: I'm a first year vocational highschool student (roughly translated), so i may not be able to respond quickly or make some good code.
